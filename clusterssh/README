Introduction
============

This utility allows multiple terminal sessions to be controlled from
a single "console".  This allows for performing the same action on 
multiple hosts concurrently.

Quick Install Guide
===================

Ensure you have the pre-requisite perl modules installed.  Required 
modules are:

	Tk
	X11::Protocol

For each of these modules, run the following command.  If it fails, 
download and install the module from http://search.cpan.org/

	$ perl -M<module> -e "print"
i.e.
	$ perl -MTk -e "print"

If all modules are present, perform the following:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install

For more advanced options, refer to the INSTALL file.

You should now be able to run
	$ cssh <server1> <server2>

Read the documentation for further information.
