Version 3 of clusterssh is a total rewrite, from scratch.  New 
features have been added, unused features have been taken away.

To list some of the bigger changes starting from version 3.0:

* Total re-write from scratch, with no code imported directly 
	from the previous version, without a review of that code
* No longer uses kernel calls, but X window messages between 
	the console and client windows
* GNU Autotools are used to build the package, in the hope it 
	makes life easier for users (and myself...)
* Also include a spec file to creating RPM's from the source
